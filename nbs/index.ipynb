The code and documentation should be modified in the notebooks `nbs/`, then run `nbdev_prepare` before a commit. This command will export the notebooks to `.py` files in `heatgeo`, it will also clean the metadata, and run some test. The page will then automatically be deployed through GitHub actions."
