# Start with HeatGeo

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

The Heat-Geodesic embedding preserves the heat-geodesic dissimilarity
defined as $$
d_t(x_i,x_j) = \bigg[ -4t \log (\mathbf{H}_t)_{ij} - \sigma 4 t \log(\mathbf{V})_{ij} \bigg] ^{1/2},
$$ where $\mathbf{H}_t$ is a heat kernel on a graph, and $\mathbf{V}$ is
a volume regularization term. This dissimilarity is inspired by
Varadhan’s formula which relates the heat kernel to the geodesic
distance on a manifold. For more details on the heat-geodesic
dissimilarity read our preprint [A Heat Diffusion Perspective on
Geodesic Preserving Dimensionality
Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19043).

## Install

The package is not yet available with pip or conda. To install it, you
can clone this repo and install from `setup.py`.

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/HeatGeo.git
cd HeatGeo
pip install -e .
```

To reproduce the results in `experiments/` or try the embeddings with
different graph constructions, you need additional packages that can be
installed via the development version. In this case run

``` sh
cd HeatGeo
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

We provide an example below.

## How to use

Google colab example on the swiss roll [![Run in Google
Colab](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Run%20in&message=Google%20Colab&color=orange&logo=Google%20Cloud.png)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SkxGfWz8KLQpcea9MsdP7QEoe-yh5Iai?usp=sharing)

The directory `experiments` contains code to reproduce our main results.
We used `hydra`, the parameters can be changed in `config` or directly
in the CLI. In `notebooks`, we provide examples on toy datasets.

## Contributing

We are using `nbdev` for this package and the documentation. See this
[introduction](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/tutorial.html) to start
using `nbdev`. The code and documentation should be modified in the
notebooks `nbs/`, then run `nbdev_prepare` before a commit. This command
will export the notebooks to `.py` files in `heatgeo`, it will also
clean the metadata, and run some test. The page will then automatically
be deployed through GitHub actions.
